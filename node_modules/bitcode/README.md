# bitcode
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bitcode.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bitcode)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/bitcode.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/bitcode)

Generate LLVM bitcode with JS API and no C++ bindings.

## What is bitcode?

[LLVM bitcode][1] is a binary representation of [LLVM IR][2] (where `IR` stands
for Intermediate Representation, and [LLVM][3] is a compiler infrastructure that
is used for building C/C++/swift/rust/etc projects with [clang][4]).

## Who needs this project?

LLVM is perfect for building languages, and for tools that generate machine
code. Instead of manual support of multiple architectures (e.g. x86_64, arm,
arm64), an architecture-independent Intermediate Representation might be
generated out of the source program. LLVM takes this representation and
transforms it to highly-optimized machine code.

Usually this is achieved through C/C++ API of LLVM. This project, however, does
the same thing using only JavaScript and Node.js Buffer API.

## Limitations

There're tons of unsupported instructions and data types in this module.
In fact, it has barely enough instructions to be useful in [llparse][5]. Should
you have any need in more types/instructions for your project - please do not
hesitate to file a bug, or (better) send a Pull Request for the feature.

In particular:

* floating point is not supported
* floating-point related optimization features (for calls, and so on) are
  absent
* int64 constant values are limited to int32 range
* vectors are not supported
* opaque structure fields are not supported
* try/catch-related instructions are not supported
* stack allocation is not supported
* memory fencing, and atomics is not supported
* no addrspace support
* no varargs
* no GC support even
* probably more

## Usage

See [`bitcode-builder`][0] for Builder API.

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { Module } from 'bitcode';

const bitcode = new Module('source-name');

// Create an instance of `bitcode-builder`
const b = bitcode.createBuilder();

// Define a function
const sig = b.signature(b.i(32), [ b.i(32), b.i(32) ]);
const fn = sig.defineFunction('fn_name', [ 'param0', 'param1' ]);

const param0 = fn.getArgument('param0');
const param1 = fn.getArgument('param1');
const sum = fn.body.binop('add', param0, param1);

fn.body.ret(sum);

// Add function to the module
bitcode.add(fn);

// Build module
fs.writeFileSync('out.bc', bitcode.build());
```

Running `opt -S out.bc` (`opt` is a part of LLVM suite) will print:

```bitcode
; ModuleID = 'out.bc'
source_filename = "source-name"

define i32 @fn_name(i32 %param0, i32 %param1) {
  %1 = add i32 %param0, %param1
  ret i32 %1
}
```
